MWSim is intended to simulate the worst-case behaviour of the boot process
in a NoC-based manycore processor.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The numbers derived by MWSim can only give a safe upper
bound, if for all nodes in the system (except for the boot node) same image
sizes are assumed. In any other case, deviations of the actual timing
behaviour from the simulated one (i.e. faster execution than assumed) may
result in timing anomalies.

Requirements:
=============
- bison
- flex

Building and Installation:
==========================
Call cmake with the root directory of this package as parameter, e.g.:

$ cd MWSIM_ROOT/build
$ cmake ..
$ make

For installation into ~/local, you may also use the build.sh script:

$ cd MWSIM_ROOT/build
$ ../build.sh ..
$ make
$ make install

To build the doxygen documentation, call:

$ make doc
